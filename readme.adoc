This repository hosts the documentation for the core format and core modules.

---

Similar to the concept of GLTF 2.0, this format consists of a Json definition and binary buffers. However, this format is firmly intended for interchange & integrity, not runtime loading optimization.
Game-engines are responsible for runtime optimization, not the 3d file format or 3d modeling tool!

It doesn't hard-code any specific resource types like GLTF. It consists of a structure of resources which get identified by a 'type' property. Support for any arbitrary type gets implemented by modules, which should be pluggable and hot-loadable.

.Core Principles
* Highly modular and extensible
* Doesn't impose any descisions on artists and game-developers
* Prioritizes developer-experience over performance
* Maximizes development speed for STF implementations and additional third party modules

Previously, a proof-of-concept for such a format has been made here: https://github.com/emperorofmars/stf-unity-poc[Repository Link]
